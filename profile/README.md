The aim of the [OpenLLM France community](https://www.openllm-france.fr) is to collaborate on the development of a French, sovereign, and truly Open Source LLM,
that would be based on
* public and open training corpora,
* documented algorithms to ensure their explicability, and
* free, non-restrictive user licenses.
