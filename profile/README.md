The aim of [OpenLLM France community](https://www.openllm-france.fr) is to collaborate to develop a French, sovereign, truly Open Source LLM,
that would be based on
* public and open learning data corpora,
* documented algorithms to ensure their explicability, and
* proposing a free non-restrictive user license.
