The aim of the [OpenLLM France community](https://www.openllm-france.fr) is to collaborate on the development of truly Open Source AI LLM models.

This space contains the software tools used to :
* collect and clean data;
* pretrain the foundation models;
* train and align the instruction models.

This space is strongly linked with the following Hugging Face space that contains and details datasets and models :

According to the OSI, open source AI model means that we provide :
* the training corpus under an open license --> Hugging Face;
* model weights under an open source non-restrictive license --> Hugging Face;
* code for data curation and training algorithms under open source licenses --> this Github space.
